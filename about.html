    <p>INTERNAL QUALITY ASSURANCE CELL(IQAC)<br>
        Quality Sustenance and Quality Enhancement are the two key words reverberating in most institutions of higher
        learning today.<br>
        NAAC is the organization that assesses and accredits institutions of Higher Education in India (HEI).<br>
        NAAC is an autonomous body funded by UGC, Government of India, MHRD headquartered in Bangalore.<br>
        NAAC insists that every accredited institution should establish an Internal Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC) as a
        "Post - Accreditation Quality Sustenance" measure and should exercise long term objectives.<br>
        And in this context, NAAC pushes every HEI to encompass a "Proactive and Functional IQAC" in its system
